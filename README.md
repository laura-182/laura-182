### Hey guys! :bar_chart:	:cityscape:

Just working from my basement office in Eastern Iowa as an R and #dataviz programmer specializing in workforce development research and evaluation.

ðŸ§¼:package:
They say bureaucracy is bad. I say the problem isn't bureacracy, it's a lack of investment (:stopwatch: & ðŸ’°) in designing the user experience for digital resources, database management, and omnichannel communication.

In other words, government websites suck, we have better ways to fill out forms, and then gov't employees can spend more time helping people instead of working with antiquated systems.
