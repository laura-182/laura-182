### Hey! :bar_chart:	:cityscape:

I work for a combined chamber of commerce, economic development, and downtown organization, handling all their data needs. Iowa native, Minnesota educated. What started as a crush on Excel has evolved into match made in R heaven. I spend my days rolling around in data from the Census, BLS, BEA, city building permits, development projects, real estate, membership directories, website analytics, email newsletters, digital marketing, and more!

Right now I'm in the process of making our data updates more efficient and automating our reports for our audiences.
